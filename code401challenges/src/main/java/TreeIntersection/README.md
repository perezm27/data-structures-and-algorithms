## Code Challenge: Class 32
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Feature Tasks
- [x] Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- [x] Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Algorithm
Used 3 ArrayLists to return a set of duplicates from 2 Trees.
