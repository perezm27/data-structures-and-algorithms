## Lab 05 : Linked Lists
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge
Implement a linked list without using any built it Class methods in Java.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Inserting the new node at the beginning of the linked list to keep insertion at O(1).
* Complexity would be O(n) due to the addition of the two while loops.
* Space is O(1).
* Creating tests to check : null values, insertion, head value, inserting multiple values.
