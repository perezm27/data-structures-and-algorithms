## Lab 10: Stack and Queue Implementation
Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) time complexity for these two data structures due to my toString method which iterates through the entire Queue & stack with O(1) space.  
<b>Stack :  </b>
* Push O(1)  
* Pop O(1)  
* Peek O(1)  

<b>Queue :  </b>
* Enqueue O(1)  
* Dequeue O(1)  
* Peek O(1)
