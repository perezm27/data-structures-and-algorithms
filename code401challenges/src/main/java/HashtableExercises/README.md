## Lab: Hash Table Implementation
Implement a Hashtable

## Featured Tasks
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

-[x] add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
-[x] get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
-[x] contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
-[x] hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Pros & Cons
Pros:
* Fast insertion & Searching
* Can be resized (should be avoided)

Cons:
* Difficult to order
* Limited in size due to them being based on arrays 

## Approach & Efficiency
* A Hash Function is used to assign Key values to elements in the hash table.
