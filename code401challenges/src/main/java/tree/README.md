## Lab 15: Binary Tree and BST Implementation
Implement a Tree

## Features
- <b>Create a Node class</b> that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- <b>Create a Tree class: </b>
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
   
 - <b>Create a BinarySearchTree class: </b>
 - Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
 - Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
 
## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O time of an insertion an searching in a Binary tree will always be O(n).  

The Big O space of a Binary Search Tree (BST) search would be O(1).  
The Big O of a Binary Search Treeâ€™s insertion and search operations is O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
