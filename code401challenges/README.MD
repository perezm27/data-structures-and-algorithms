# Reverse an Array
A short Java program that reverses an array.

## Challenge
The challenge was to define a method which takes in an array of integers and returns that array in decending order.

## Approach & Efficiency
- [x] Write a method that takes in an array of integers as argument
- [x] Instatiate a new array of integers to hold our reversed values
- [x] iterate through input array in reverse order with reverse for loop
- [x] assign reversed values into output Array at the reversed index subtracted by i
- [x] return output array
